# Security Risk Assessment Report

## Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement
1. **Password policies and Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**
2. **Firewall maintenance and port filtering**
3. **Baseline configurations and configuration checks**

## Part 2: Explain your recommendations

- **Password policies and MFA**  
  Strong password policies ensure employees no longer share or reuse weak credentials, and MFA adds another layer of defense against brute force and credential theft. Together, these reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems.  

- **Firewall maintenance and port filtering**  
  Properly configured firewalls with deny-by-default rules and port filtering restrict both inbound and outbound traffic. This limits attackersâ€™ ability to exploit open ports or move laterally in the network, reducing exposure to external threats.  

- **Baseline configurations and configuration checks**  
  Establishing secure baseline builds and performing regular configuration checks ensure that no systems are left with default credentials or insecure settings. This allows the organization to detect and remediate misconfigurations quickly, reducing the likelihood of repeat breaches.
